# Wordle-like Game (Rick Roll Edition)

This is a Wordle imitation game designed to rickroll the player. The game presents the player with a series of word boxes, and the player must guess the correct word by typing in letters. The game is timed, and the player must guess all the words before the time runs out.

## How to Play

1. Open the `wordle.html` file in your web browser.
2. Type in letters to guess the correct word.
3. Press Enter to submit your guess.
4. If you guess the correct word, the game will move on to the next word.
5. If you guess the incorrect word, you will be rickrolled.
6. If you guess all the words before the time runs out, you win!

## How to Customize

You can customize the game by modifying the `words` array in the `wordle.js` file.

## The fun catch

Whoever plays this game will be rickrolled if they guess the words correctly.
